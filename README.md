The files in this site can be used to build a remote rotator system that fits onto a MastWerks mast that is part of the BuddiHex antenna system from Buddipole (www.buddipole.com).  This system has two major components. The first is an arduino-based controller board mounted in a water resistant commercially available box.  The second is a worm gear motor mounted in a water resistant commercially available box.  The controller board is attached to the MastWerks mast using 3D-printed latching clamp.  The motor is mounted on the MastWerks mast using a 3D printed adapter that fits onto the crank attachment point.  The 3D printer files are available at www.printables.com.  The PCB used in this project is available from PCBWay at https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/MastWerks_BuddiHex_Remote_Mast_Rotator_Control_Board_v1_1_d22fbad5.html .
